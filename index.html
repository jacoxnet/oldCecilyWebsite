                            <p class='card-text'>
                            My name is Cecily Cox,
                            </p><p>
                                I am very excited about the opportunity to teach and hope to teach all subjects in elementary 
                                education. I would be honored to impact the life of a child in the crucial years of early 
                                education, and I hope you will consider me for an elementary teaching position.
                            </p><p>
                                I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree from Southern Methodist University, where I received 
                                a degree in Human Rights and Sociology. Since graduating, I have worked for political campaigns, 
                                developing and implementing voter engagement strategies. I have also worked as a swim instructor, 
                                student taught as a volunteer in a fourth-grade classroom, taught second-grade elementary school 
                                in the Diocese of San Jose, and currently, I teach first grade in the Diocese of Oakland. During this time, 
                                I learned the basics of differentiated instruction, classroom management, and core curriculum. 
                                These opportunities gave me incredible hands-on experience and solidified my love of educating children 
                                and my ability to manage a large classroom.
                            </p><p>
                                I have also participated in study abroad programs in France, China, Korea, and Israel. I have a strong 
                                grasp of Spanish, French, and Latin, which gives me a unique advantage when it comes to appreciating different 
                                cultures and understanding the different learning styles of English Language Learners
                            </p><p>
                                I am currently enrolled in the Master of Teaching program at Santa Clara University, 
                                where I am working on a cross-disciplinary qualification in early education. I hope to obtain 
                                this qualification in the next two years. I am eager to teach, but also inspired to learn more 
                                about the educational process and the development of young minds.

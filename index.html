                        <p class='card-text'>
                        My name is Cecily Cox,
                        </p><p>
                            I am very excited about the opportunity to teach and hope to teach all subjects in elementary 
                            education. I would be honored to impact the life of a child in the crucial years of early 
                            education, and I hope you will consider me for an elementary teaching position.
                        </p><p>
                            I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree from Southern Methodist University, where I received 
                            a degree in Human Rights and Sociology. Since graduating, I have worked for political campaigns, 
                            developing and implementing voter engagement strategies. I have also worked as a swim instructor, 
                            student taught as a volunteer in a fourth-grade classroom, taught second-grade elementary school 
                            in the Diocese of San Jose, and currently, I teach first grade in the Diocese of Oakland. During this time, 
                            I learned the basics of differentiated instruction, classroom management, and core curriculum. 
                            These opportunities gave me incredible hands-on experience and solidified my love of educating children 
                            and my ability to manage a large classroom.
                        </p><p>
                            I have also participated in study abroad programs in France, China, Korea, and Israel. I have a strong 
                            grasp of Spanish, French, and Latin, which gives me a unique advantage when it comes to appreciating different 
                            cultures and understanding the different learning styles of English Language Learners
                        </p><p>
                            I am currently enrolled in the Master of Teaching program at Santa Clara University, 
                            where I am working on a cross-disciplinary qualification in early education. I hope to obtain 
                            this qualification in the next two years. I am eager to teach, but also inspired to learn more 
                            about the educational process and the development of young minds.
                        </p>

                                                For example, "cat" and "hat" are rhyming words. Teacher will then read aloud some entries from the book of nursery rhymes, and
                                                emphasize the rhyming words as you go along. After each rhyme, ask students to tell you what rhyming words they noticed.</p>

                                                emphasize whatever rhyming words you come across. Pause occasionally, and ask students to identify any 
                                                rhyming words they've noticed.</p>

                                                rhyming cards and they have to find their partner who has the word that rhymes 
                                                with the card they were presented with.</p>

                                                <p>Students will distribute different My Rhyming Book worksheets to each student. Have students work on
                                                completing their pages.</p>

                                                <p>Students will then watch a Youtube video, which explains to beginners/kids how to use the basic features 
                                                of Garageband:</p>

                                                <p>Students will then be shown how to create and record a short rhyming poem.  As a class, we will
                                                then write a short rhyming poem and record it on Garageband. Finally, the students will be paired up 
                                                into groups of 4 and use their iPads to create a song or poem, which would be recorded on Garageband.</p>

                                                <p>At the end of the week, we will listen to all recordings, and students will clap for each student 
                                                that has presented their audio project.</p>

                                                write down all of the rhyming words in the book. Support: Have one-on-one review sessions with 
                                                struggling students. Go over different pairs of rhyming words with them to make sure they understand 
                                                the concept of end rhymes. Assessment (10 minutes) Distribute pencils and sheets of paper to
                                                the class. Ask each student to write down three pairs of rhyming words on his sheet. Then,
                                                ask students to write down as many examples of rhyming words from Hop on Pop as they can.
                                                Collect the sheets and look over them after the lesson to assess each student's understanding of 
                                                the material. Review and closing (5 minutes) Remind students of the definition of rhyming words: 
                                                words that have the same ending sounds. Tell them that most songs, nursery rhymes, and poems have
                                                rhyming words. Advise them to keep their eyes and ears open for rhyming words 
                                                whenever they listen to songs or read poetry.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Engagement:</strong> Students will foster collaboration and community. 
                                                Students will be paired in groups with students of varying abilities.  Together,
                                                students must work together to come up with a few sentences that rhyme.  
                                                They will then have to work together to record an audio file of their poem using Garageband.
                                                This is beneficial for some students who may be uncomfortable writing,
                                                this gives them the opportunity to work orally. Furthermore, students who
                                                do struggle occasionally will have other students to speak with and ask questions 
                                                and discuss creative options for the audio files.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Representation:</strong>Offer alternatives for auditory information.  
                                                In addition to the video, which explains how to use Garageband, there will
                                                be a handout that will go along with the video for students who learn best
                                                by reading information instead of learning from audio files. Additionally, the
                                                nursery rhymes will also be printed out for students who learn best by reading
                                                information instead of audio files.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Action and Expression:</strong>Use multiple media for communication.
                                                Students will be given handouts, videos, and a lecture to understand how to
                                                compose an audio file to record their rhyming sentences, which helps instruct
                                                students who learn in different ways as it offers different types of learners
